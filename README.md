# STEM4ukraine-Saint-Javelin

A simple PCB with sound effects and the light show set off by pressing of the button!

An ideal school STEM project demonstrating use of GPIO for detecting button presses with software debouncing, charlieplexxing of multiple LEDs and playing music on the Piezo speaker.

Celebrate Saint Javelin while you play the Ukrainian national anthem on the built in speaker!
